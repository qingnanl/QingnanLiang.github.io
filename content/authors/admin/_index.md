I am currently a postdoctoral associtate in Dr. Ken Chen's lab @ MDACC. I developed a clustering-independent single-cell pathway analysis algorithm, GSDensity, as my first postdoc work (Liang et al., Nature Communications 2023, https://github.com/qingnanl/gsdensity). This algorithm can be applied to both single-cell RNA-seq and spatial genomics data. During my Ph.D study at Baylor College of Medicine, I led the Human Cell Atlas (HCA) human retina multi-omic atlas analysis during my Ph.D. (Liang et al., Nature Communications 2019; Liang et al., Cell Genomics 2023). 

I also have rich wet lab experiences in biochemistry and genetics endorsed by multiple publications (10+ years, representative publications: Liang et al., Journal of Structural Biology 2015; Liang et al., Human Molecular Genetics 2021).
